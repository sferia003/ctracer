Manan Bhatia worked on structuring the project efficiently and intuitively. He helped me organize the back-end and base classes to maximize readability and functionality. He helped answer questions and solve issues that I brought up, and overall, he was a helpful member in making this application a reality. I could not have done it without him, and I am glad that I had someone as knowledgeable as him to assist me in this endeavor.
